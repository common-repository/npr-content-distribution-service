# Pulling a Single Story from the NPR CDS

Once you have the [NPR CDS Plugin configured](/docs/settings.md), you can easily pull a story from the CDS into WordPress using a Story ID or URL.

In the WordPress Dashboard under **Posts** you will see a link for **Get NPR Stories**:

This opens a screen with a single field where you can paste a Story ID:

Alternatively, you can copy and paste the full URL of a story from the NPR website or the website of an NPR member station:

You have the choice to create a draft post of the story, or publish the story immediately. Either way, you can edit the story like any other WordPress post:

## NPR Story Custom Fields

Stories in the NPR CDS contain a lot of metadata. When you pull a story from the CDS, WordPress will store this metadata in custom fields. This may include audio files, bylines, image captions and credits, and many other values including the story ID:

If you don't see these custom fields in the post edit screen, click **Screen Options** in the upper right and then the checkbox for Custom Fields.

## Using NPR CDS Custom Fields in your WordPress theme

The custom fields generated by the NPR CDS provide a lot of flexibility for displaying CDS content in various ways. If you are familiar with WordPress theming, you could customize your WordPress theme to use the custom fields in your templates. For a reference on how to use these additional fields in your theme, refer to [the relevant documentation](https://codex.wordpress.org/Custom_Fields) in the WordPress Codex.
